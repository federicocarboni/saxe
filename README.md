# Saxe

Light-weight and efficient SAX parser for JavaScript (~5.87KB minified and gzipped).

## Goals

- Complete XML standard conformance
- Simple and terse API
- Set a base for other standards built on XML, e.g. XHTML

## Example

```js
import {SaxParser} from "saxe";

let textContent = "";
const parser = new SaxParser({
  start(name, attributes) {
    // element start tag
  },
  empty(name, attributes) {
    // empty element
  },
  end(name, attributes) {
    // element end tag
  },
  text(text) {
    textContent += text;
  },
});
for (const chunk of INPUT_STREAM) {
  parser.write(chunk);
}
parser.end();
```

## Runtime Support

Basic XML parsing is supported on any ES2017 runtime. Older runtimes can still
run `saxe` after transpilation and polyfilling any missing functionality.

Encoding support requires [`TextDecoder`]; most runtimes support it natively,
but it may be polyfilled.

## Document Type Declaration

Most[^1] JavaScript XML parsers skip Document Type Declarations (DTD) without
even checking for well-formedness or ignore most declarations.

This parser checks the whole internal DTD subset for well-formedness and
recognizes `ATTLIST` and `ENTITY` declarations, so attributes are normalized
appropriately and entities are expanded correctly. This process has [security
implications](#security); if the default behavior is undesirable it may be
changed.

Internal DTD subset parsing is required even for non-validating[^2] parsers.
External markup declarations and external entities are not supported and will
never be.

  [NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser] and [lddubeau/saxes]
[^2]: Non-validating XML processors (parsers) do not validate documents, but
  must still recognize and report well-formedness (syntax) errors.
  Non-validating processors are not required to fetch and parse external markup
  declarations and external entities.

## Encoding Support

XML allows documents to specify their encoding through the XML or Text
Declarations.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
```

Parsing XML from raw binary data in unknown encoding is supported by the
`SaxDecoder` class, which parses XML from `Uint8Array` chunks.

Do not use `SaxDecoder` when encoding information is provided externally, e.g.
`Content-Type` MIME type or another specification, e.g. EPUB specifies all XML
files MUST be `UTF-8`.

### Supported Encodings

`SaxDecoder` uses [`TextDecoder`] so it supports all encodings defined by the
[Encoding Standard].

A polyfill may only implement a subset of the [Encoding Standard ยง 4.
Encodings]. For full compliance ensure at least `UTF-8`
and `UTF-16` are supported, as they are required by the XML standard.

**Notes:**

- If a document specifies an unknown or unsupported encoding a
  `SaxError` with code `ENCODING_NOT_SUPPORTED` is thrown.
- If a document contains data which is invalid for the declared encoding a
  `SaxError` with code `ENCODING_INVALID_DATA` is thrown.

## Security

XML Parsers may be subject to a number of possible vulnerabilities, most common
attacks exploit external entity resolution and entity expansion.

This parser is strictly non-validating, so by design it should not be vulnerable
to any XXE[^3] based attack. Additionally the length of strings collected during
parsing is capped to limit the efficacy of other denial-of-service attacks[^4].

Document Type Declaration processing may (at user option) be disabled altogether
to prevent any attack based on them.

```js
// Doctype declarations will be rejected
// Alternatively, set to "ignore" to allow them but prevent
// them from affecting further parsing
new SaxParser(reader, {dtd: "prohibit"})
```

[Known XML Bombs](/test/data/) are tested for as part of regular integration
tests and the parser is [fuzz tested](/fuzz/) regularly. Despite this being the
case, for very sensible or security oriented apps you may want to conduct your
own security audit.
